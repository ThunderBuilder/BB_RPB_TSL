## Important Thing to notice
### 1) Do not use this strategy on live. It is still undergoing dry-run. 
Using it live at your own risk.
### 2) Limit order buy (if high latency) / Market order buy (if low latency) 
Or get rekt by slippage.
### 3) Don't use volume list or use volume list with very strict filters
This strategy is not optimized towards all trading pairs, and it cannot predict and prevent P&D (pump and dump).
### 4) If you want to show appreciation, 
Please notice a huge part of this strategy is a re-combination of NFI, I don't deserve the credit.
If you want to show appreciation, please buy a coffee for [@iterativ](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity).
