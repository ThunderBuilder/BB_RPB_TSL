## Important Thing to notice
### 1) Do not use this strategy on live. It is still undergoing dry-run.
### 2) The Hyperopt is highly optimized towards "shitcoin" play. If U want to use, you may need to re-hyperopt. 
My computer is not good enough to run more pairs.
### 3) The strategy is not good at uptrend and it performs better at sideway and downtrend.
