## Important Thing to notice
### 1) Do not use this strategy on live. It is still undergoing dry-run. 
Using it live at your own risk.
### 2) If you want to use the strategy, you may need to re-hyperopt. 
It is hyperopt against arond 30 pairs (20210507-20210904). My computer is simply not good enough to run more pairs.
### 3) The strategy is not as good in uptrend as it performs in sideway and downtrend.
### 4) Limit order buy (if high latency) / Market order buy (if low latency) 
Or get rekt by slippage.
### 5) Don't use volume list or use volume list with very strict filters
This strategy is not optimized towards all trading pairs, and it cannot predict and prevent P&D (pump and dump)
